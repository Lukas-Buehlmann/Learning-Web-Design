Homepage: Currently this needs a lot of work and has been delayed a bit. I will return to fix the CSS and make it look nice later!

Cube visualiser: This is capable of creating any dimension of cube and applying rotations. 
  It currently cannot view cubes higher than 5D properly since the camera exists in the cube for part of the rotation.
  It also uses many rotation functions that are not needed anymore since a general rotation function was created.
  The last important piece to add is some control for the user from the webpage to modify the cube in real time.

Snake: This was just a chance to learn how to use JavaScript for a simple game and it turned out alright but still has a bit more refining needed.

Mandelbrot set: This is still far from finished! There is absolutely no user friendliness to this so here are the controls:
  WASD moves the viewport
  E increases detail
  Q decreases detail
  SPACE resets detail
  C increases resolution. CAUTION: increasing too high severely increases lag
  X decreases resolution
  M toggles Mandelbrot and Julia set
  MOUSE position determines Julia set values
  LEFT CLICK locks current Julia set values
  UP/DOWN ARROW & MOUSEWHEEL apply zoom in/out

  This will all be finished once I have time to return to this project and please bear in mind that it is intended for learning and not as a final product
