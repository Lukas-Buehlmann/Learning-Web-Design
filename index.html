            <h2>Webpage Description</h2>
            This webpage will act as the homepage for all of the javascript projects that I decide to create.
             I plan to make the homepage more interesting in the future but for the moment it will just be a 
             nearly blank page.

            <h2>What I plan to add</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>First project: Snake! This should be a really easy project to learn about using js for graphics</li>
                <li>Minesweeper. This will have some twist on it or I will make a program that solves the puzzle</li>
                <li>Neural network. We'll see if I actually get around to implementing this in JS. I already have a java version that I could translate</li>
                <li>Pathfinding algorithm. Add A* and some other variants</li>
                <li>Maybe some physics or graphics thing???</li>
                <li>4D-cube render. Could be a good homepage simulation</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        Consider working on the styles of this in the future
